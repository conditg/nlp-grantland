# Machine Learning: Natural Language Processing & Grantland

Grantland.com was a long-form sports & pop culture journalism site that was closed by Disney/ESPN in 2015. In this project, Unsupervised Learning and Natural Language Processing is used to cluster a selection of articles and Supervised Learning is used to predict the contributor of each article.

Start with the PDF [here](https://github.com/conditg/nlp-grantland/blob/master/NLP-Grantland.pdf), which is an easy visual overview of the project and outcomes. 

The notebook that shows how the data was collected is [GLscraper](https://github.com/conditg/nlp-grantland/blob/master/GLscraper.ipynb). The article texts are stored in data.zip.

If you'd like to dig deeper, I recommend viewing the main notebook on NBViewer [HERE](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/conditg/nlp-grantland/blob/8ae75021d7252e1b7faa3731af7b26800a0b9ec5/GrantlandTribute.ipynb), which enables some fun stuff like interactive 3D graphs of clustering solutions.
